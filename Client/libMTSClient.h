     How to use libMTSClient:

     On startup in the constructor:

        MTSClient *client = MTS_RegisterClient();

     On shutdown in the destructor:

        MTS_DeregisterClient(client);

     When given a note:

        double f=MTS_NoteToFrequency(client, midinote, midichannel);
     OR
        double retune_semitones=MTS_RetuningInSemitones(client, midinote, midichannel);
     OR
        double retune_ratio=MTS_RetuningAsRatio(client, midinote, midichannel);

     If you don’t have the midi channel, use -1, but supplying the channel allows support for microtonal
     MIDI controllers with more than 128 keys that use multi-channel keyboard mappings.

     Querying retune whilst a note is playing allows the tuning to change along the flight of the note,
     which is the ideal, so do this if you can and as often as possible. Ideally at the same time as processing
     any other pitch modulation sources (envelopes, MIDI controllers, LFOs etc.).

     The Scala .kbm keyboard mapping file format allows for MIDI keys to be unmapped i.e. no frequency
     is specified for them. The MTS-ESP library supports this. You can query whether a note
     is unmapped and should be ignored with:

        bool should_ignore_note = MTS_ShouldFilterNote(client, midinote, midichannel);

     If this returns true, ignore the noteOn and don’t play anything. Calling this function is encouraged but
     optional and a valid value for the frequency/retuning will still be returned for an unmapped note. Once again
     if you don’t have the midi channel, use -1, however supplying it allows a master to dedicate notes on specific
     channels for e.g. key switches to change tunings.
     
     A helper function is available which returns the MIDI note number whose pitch is nearest a given frequency.
     The MIDI note number returned is guaranteed to be mapped. If the destination channel for the MIDI note is
     known it should be supplied so that any channel-specific note filtering can be respected.

     To add support for MIDI Tuning System to your plugin (from the MIDI Spec, using sysex), both dump and realtime,
     implement the above and, when given sysex, call:

        MTS_ParseMIDIData(client, buffer, len); // if buffer is signed char *
     OR
        MTS_ParseMIDIDataU(client, buffer, len); // if buffer is unsigned char *

     If you want to tell the user whether you can see a Master in the session, call:

        bool has_master = MTS_HasMaster(client);

     If you want to tell the user what scale the Master is using, call:

        const char *name = MTS_GetScaleName(client);
     
     */
    
    // Opaque datatype for MTSClient.
    typedef struct MTSClient MTSClient;

    // Register/deregister as a client.  Call from the plugin constuctor and destructor.
    extern MTSClient *MTS_RegisterClient();
    extern void MTS_DeregisterClient(MTSClient *client);

    // Check if the client is currently connected to a master plugin.
    extern bool MTS_HasMaster(MTSClient *client);

    // Returns true if note should not be played. MIDI channel argument is optional but should be included if possible (0-15), else set to -1.
    extern bool MTS_ShouldFilterNote(MTSClient *client, char midinote, char midichannel);

    // Returns the note number whose pitch is closest to that supplied. Destination MIDI channel should be included if known (0-15), else set to -1.
    extern char MTS_FrequencyToNote(MTSClient *client, double freq, char midichannel);
    
    // Returns the name of the current scale.
    extern const char *MTS_GetScaleName(MTSClient *client);
