    /*
     MTS Master interface - for creating MTS Master plugins, one per session, which will control
     tuning for all MTS-ESP-compatible plugins in the session.

     On startup in the constructor:

        MTS_RegisterMaster();


     On shutdown in the destructor:

        MTS_DeregisterMaster();


     To determine whether the user has already instanced a master (don’t instance if this returns false) call:

        bool can_register_master = MTS_CanRegisterMaster();


     To configure the tunings for the entire session, call:

        double frequencies_in_hz[128]; // Fill this in
        MTS_SetNoteTunings(frequencies_in_hz);
     OR
        MTS_SetNoteTuning(frequency_in_hz, midinote);


     To tell clients to ignore a note, call:

        MTS_FilterNote(should_ignore, midinote, midichannel);

     Supply -1 for the midichannel argument if the note should be ignored on all MIDI channels.
     Note that it is optional for a client to provide a MIDI channel when querying whether a note
     should be filtered. If not provided, a client will filter any notes set via this function
     regardless of MIDI channel. Although encouraged, it is also optional for a client to check note
     filtering at all, so it is suggested to provide a frequency for all MIDI notes, even unmapped ones.
     Ideally unmapped notes should use the frequency of the next lowest mapped note, or next highest
     if there is none lower.


     To reset the ignored notes, call:

        MTS_ClearNoteFilter();


     To tell the user how many clients you can see connected, call:

        int num_connected = MTS_GetNumClients();


     To tell clients the scale name, call:

        MTS_ScaleName(“Scale name”);


     Some MIDI controllers for microtonal work have more than 128 keys where the same note number
     may be mapped to different frequencies across different MIDI channels. To support these, use:

        MTS_SetMultiChannel(is_part_of_the_multichannel_system, midichannel);

     And then:

        MTS_SetMultiChannelNoteTunings, MTS_SetMultiChannelNoteTuning, MTS_FilterNoteMultiChannel, MTS_ClearNoteFilterMultiChannel

     Which are as above, but take the MIDI channel as an extra parameter. Multi-channel support will only
     work with clients that provide a MIDI channel when querying both note filtering and retuning.
     Clients that don't provide a MIDI channel will use the frequencies and note filtering provided using
     the non-multi-channel functions, therefore it is advised to always provide a general tuning table in addition
     to a multi-channel one.
     
     
     After registering, you may wish to let the user know if they have an older version of the libMTS dynamic library
     installed which may not support some features in this version of the API:
     
        bool should_update = MTS_Master_ShouldUpdateLibrary();
     
     The latest version of libMTS will always be backward compatible with masters built with
     an older version of the API. Users can update libMTS using the installers at
     https://github.com/ODDSound/MTS-ESP/tree/main/libMTS.
     
     
     IPC support:
     
     MTS_HasIPC() allows you to check if the process in which the plug-in is running is using IPC for sharing MTS-ESP
     tuning data. If a DAW crashes, MTS_DeregisterMaster() may not get called. If this happens when using IPC the
     shared memory will persist and MTS_HasMaster() will still return true, even if no other master is instanced.
     To allow for this case we have included the MTS_Reinitialize() function which will reset the MTS-ESP library,
     including tuning tables, scale name, note filters, client count and master connection status.
     
     IMPORTANT: ONLY if MTS_CanRegisterMaster() returns false and MTS_HasIPC() returns true is it advisable to offer an option to
     the user to reinitialize MTS-ESP. Follow reinitialization with a call to MTS_RegisterMaster(). The code for registering
     as a master should follow this pattern:
     
         if (MTS_CanRegisterMaster())
             MTS_RegisterMaster();
         else
         {
             if (MTS_HasIPC())
             {
                 Warn user another master is already connected, but provide an option to reinitialize MTS-ESP in case there was a crash and no master is connected any more;
                 if (user clicks to reinitialize MTS-ESP)
                 {
                     MTS_Reinitialize();
                     MTS_RegisterMaster();
                 }
             }
             else
                 Warn user another master is already connected, do not provide an option to reinitialize MTS-ESP;
         }
